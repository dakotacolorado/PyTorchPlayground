# PyTorch Playground

This repository documents my learnings and experiments with PyTorch using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Objective

My goal is to utilize PyTorch's capabilities and craft neural network models for [ChineseCheckersGameEngine](https://github.com/dakotacolorado/ChineseCheckersGameEngine).

## Experiments & Explorations

The `FeatureFocusNotebooks` directory houses Jupyter Notebooks, each centered on a specific PyTorch feature. Here, I've explored tensor operations, neural network creation, and more, illustrated with code snippets, plots, and notes.

## Skills & Concepts Explored (so far)

- **Tensor Operations:** Basics of tensors.
- **Gradient Descent:** Techniques for optimization.
- **Building Neural Networks:** Delving into PyTorchâ€™s `nn.Module`.
