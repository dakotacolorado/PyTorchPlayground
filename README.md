# PyTorch Playground

Welcome to my PyTorch Playground! This repository documents my journey learning and experimenting with the PyTorch library, exploring its various features and functionalities through a series of Jupyter Notebooks.

## üöÄ Objective

My objective is to delve into PyTorch's deep learning capabilities, creating a sandbox where I can freely explore, experiment, and jot down my learnings and observations.

üëÄ **Audience:** This repository is intended for recruiters, hiring managers, and developers who are interested in observing my progression, curiosity, and hands-on exploration of deep learning concepts using PyTorch.

## üìò FeatureFocusNotebooks Directory

### What's Inside?

In the `FeatureFocusNotebooks` directory, you'll find a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a specific feature or concept in PyTorch. These notebooks are not courses or tutorials but rather a patchwork quilt of my explorations, questions, and "aha!" moments as I navigate through the PyTorch API.

### Notebook Naming Convention

The notebooks are prefixed with numbers indicating the sequence in which they were explored and written:
- `01_Tensor_Basics.ipynb`
- `02_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`
- `03_Neural_Networks_Basics.ipynb`
... and so forth.

## üß™ Experiments & Explorations

Throughout these notebooks, I've experimented with various aspects of PyTorch, from fundamental tensor operations to building simple neural networks. Expect to see code snippets, plots, and markdown notes detailing my thoughts and findings.

## ü§ñ Skills & Concepts Explored

- **Tensor Operations:** Basics of creating and manipulating tensors.
- **Gradient Descent:** Experimentation with optimization technques.
- **Building Neural Networks:** Structuring basic neural networks and exploring PyTorch‚Äôs `nn.Module`.

## üßê What to Look For

- **Problem Solving:** How I approach and solve challenges and new concepts.
- **Curiosity:** The questions and further explorations that arise from my initial experiments.
- **Code Quality:** My coding and commenting practices in a learning/experimental environment.
