    "### 2.1 Neural Network Approach for Chinese Checkers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Train a model to assess the probability of a win for each player based on a given game state in Chinese Checkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Structure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**:\n",
    "    - Represents the game state. Depending on the representation, this could be a one-dimensional array (flattened) or a two-dimensional grid resembling the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Layer**:\n",
    "    - Comprises two neurons, one for each player. Each produces a score indicating the likelihood of that player winning from the given game state.\n",
    "    - Scores are continuous values between 0 (certain loss) and 1 (certain win).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scoring Mechanism**:\n",
    "    - For a given game state, if Player 1's neuron outputs a score of `x`, then Player 2's score is `1 - x`. This ensures the scores are complementary and the sum is always 1.\n",
    "    - Early in the game, scores are expected to be close to 0.5 for both players, indicating no clear advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Training**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**:\n",
    "    - Amass a large dataset of game states with their outcomes, either through simulation or from historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Labeling**:\n",
    "    - Assign scores to each game state for each player. This score denotes the probability of each player winning from that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimization**:\n",
    "    - Employ an appropriate loss function, such as mean squared error, to train the neural network.\n",
    "    - The training goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted scores and the true outcomes of the game states.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A score closer to 1 for Player 1 denotes a high likelihood of Player 1 winning from that state. Conversely, a score near 0 signifies a higher chance for Player 2's victory.\n"
